# intercert [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evenh/intercert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evenh/intercert) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/evenh/intercert)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/evenh/intercert)

_Brings Let's Encrypt to LAN and other locked down environments._

---
**This is a work in progress (unstable). Contributions are very welcome!**

## How it works

1. A server instance is running somewhere in your network infrastructure, with network access to
your DNS [provider of choice](https://github.com/go-acme/lego/tree/master/providers/dns) and the ACME directory you'll want to use (Let's Encrypt most likely).    
The server is configured with the DNS names you control (e.g. `somecompany.io` and `other.co`).
2. Clients are deployed on the machines where you need the certificates for your applications.
3. Certificates magically appear on the client machine in the directory you've configured.

## Thanks

A huge thanks to these projects

- [certmagic](https://github.com/mholt/certmagic) - does the hard work for intercert
- [lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego) - the underpinning library for certmagic, and provides the DNS validation capability
